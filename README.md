# Mystery Function

What does the `mystery()` function in the following piece of code do? Add your
answer to this markdown file.

```javascript
function mystery(a) {
    if(a.length == 1) return a[0];
    var foo = mystery(a.slice(1, a.length))
    if(foo > a[0]) return foo;
    else return a[0];
}
```

This function returns the largest character in a given array. For instance, if the function is given ['a', 'b', 'c'] then it will return 'c'. It refers to letters in their unicode counterparts, and since strings are stored as arrays it works with those as well.
